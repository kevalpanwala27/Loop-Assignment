📊 Loop Store Monitoring API
A Node.js powered REST API that monitors store online/offline status and generates detailed reports on uptime and downtime — accurately handling business hours and timezone-specific logic.
🚀 Features

📥 CSV-based Data Ingestion
Import store status, business hours, and timezone data from CSV files.
📈 Uptime/Downtime Report Generation
Calculates store availability metrics — filtered by business hours and timezone.
⏱ Real-time Report Status
Trigger reports asynchronously and poll for completion.
🌐 Timezone-Aware Calculations
Automatically converts timestamps to store-local time for accuracy.

🛠 Tech Stack

Node.js & Express.js – REST API
Sequelize ORM – Database models & query abstraction
SQLite – Lightweight DB for local development (easily swappable with PostgreSQL)
CSV Parser/Writers – Efficient CSV file reading and writing
Moment-Timezone – Timezone handling & conversion

📁 CSV Data Files
Place the following files in the /data directory:
FilenameDescriptionstore_status.csvStore online/offline status logs with timestampsmenu_hours.csvWeekly business hours per storetimezone.csvTimezone info mapped to each store

📍 Trigger Report Generation
POST /api/trigger_report
Response:
json{
"report_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
📄 Get Report Status / Download Report
GET /api/get_report/:reportId
If Report is Still Processing:
json{
"status": "Running"
}
If Report is Ready:
Returns a downloadable CSV file with the following headers:
store_id,uptime_last_hour(mins),uptime_last_day(hrs),uptime_last_week(hrs),downtime_last_hour(mins),downtime_last_day(hrs),downtime_last_week(hrs)
⚙️ How It Works

CSV data is ingested into a SQLite database.
When a report is triggered:

Status logs are analyzed per store.
Uptime/downtime is calculated across various windows: last hour, day, week.
Only business hours (from menu_hours.csv) are considered.
All timestamps are converted based on the store's timezone (timezone.csv).
A downloadable report is generated and stored locally.

✅ Example Report Output
